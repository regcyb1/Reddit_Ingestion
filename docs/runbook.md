## Common Incidents & Response

### 1. Service Not Responding

**Symptoms**: 
- `/health` endpoint returns non-200 response
- Client requests timeout

**Response**:
1. Check service logs for errors: `kubectl logs -l app=reddit-ingestion -f`
2. Verify proxy connectivity is working
3. Check for memory or CPU constraints
4. Restart the service if necessary: `kubectl rollout restart deployment reddit-ingestion`
5. If issue persists, check for Reddit API changes or proxy blocks

---

### 2. High Error Rate from Reddit API

**Symptoms**:
- Logs show many 429 (Too Many Requests) or 403 (Forbidden) responses
- Data retrieval is incomplete

**Response**:
1. Verify proxy URLs are valid and working
2. Check if Reddit is experiencing issues (status.reddit.com)
3. Add more proxies to the rotation
4. Increase `PROXY_MAX_RETRIES` and `RATE_LIMIT_DELAY`
5. Consider implementing a circuit breaker to pause requests temporarily

---

### 3. Memory Usage Spikes

**Symptoms**:
- Container memory usage approaches limits
- OOM (Out of Memory) errors in logs

**Response**:
1. Check which endpoints are being called (large subreddits or posts with many comments)
2. Limit concurrent requests or reduce page size limits
3. Increase memory allocation if needed
4. Implement pagination for large result sets
5. Investigate possible memory leaks if issue persists

---

### 4. Slow Response Times

**Symptoms**:
- Endpoints take >30s to respond
- Post Endpoint can take upto 300s to respond depending upon the no of comments
- Timeouts occur frequently

**Response**:
1. Check Reddit API response times in logs
2. Verify proxy speed and connectivity
3. Monitor CPU usage for potential bottlenecks
4. Consider scaling up the service horizontally
5. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
