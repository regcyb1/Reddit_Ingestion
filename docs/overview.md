## What It Does

- Fetches posts from subreddits with customizable limits and filters
- Retrieves user information, posts, and comments
- Gets detailed post data including all comments (even expanding "load more" sections)
- Performs Reddit searches with various filters
- Rotates through multiple proxies to avoid rate limiting
- Implements browser fingerprinting to mimic legitimate browsers
- Retries failed requests with exponential backoff

## How It Fits

The system is designed with distinct components:

- **API Layer**: HTTP endpoints for different Reddit content types
- **Scraper Service**: Business logic for data collection with pagination support
- **Parser**: Converts Reddit API responses into structured data models
- **Client**: Handles HTTP requests with proxy rotation and retries
- **Utils**: Proxy management and browser fingerprinting
- **Testing Layer**: Validates system components independently and together
